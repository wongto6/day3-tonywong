O: I learnt the motivations and flow of refactoring today. Running test case before and after each change is necessary
for refactoring. Besides, I learnt and practised drawing concept map today. We used the example of TDD to draw concept
map today.

R: I found refactoring less challenging after learning the flow today. As I previously often concerned my change would 
need to unwanted changes of program output when I did refactor task in the past. Now I can rerun test cases whenever
I made any change to narrow the scope of potential problems.

I: By narrowing down the scope of potential problems during refactoring, it will be easier for me to fix the problem
and complete the refactor task.

D: I will adopt TDD for refactor tasks in addition to development task in the future, although TDD requires more time 
and effort in the beginning stage to prepare test cases, it will pay off by facilitating factoring codes (by acting as 
safenet) and helping me to estimate my progress correctly.
